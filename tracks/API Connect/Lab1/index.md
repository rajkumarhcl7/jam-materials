# Create and Publish your first REST API to expose an existing REST Service

${toc}

## 1. Objectives

In this lab you will learned how to:

- Create an API by importing an OpenAPI definition for an existing REST service.

- Configure ClientID/Secret Security, endpoints, and proxy to invoke endpoint.

- Test a REST API in the Developer Toolkit.

- Publish an API for developers.

## 2. Prerequisites

-  Setup the lab environment. If you have not setup the lab environment yet then follow the instructions  provided in the link [[here](https://github.com/IBMIntegration/jam-in-a-box-2/blob/main/README.md)]
  
- Create **Provider Organization** and Configure **Developer portal**. Go through [FAQs](https://ibmintegration.github.io/jam-in-a-box/faq)

- Go through the presentation to get the knowledge about API connect capabilities. Cleck [here](https://ibm.box.com/s/zdvlrkbmobejvkd5hzhiqf7jur4fc6sj)


## 3. Getting started with lab1

Before we can use API Connect we must publish an API to expose. We will deploy a Customer Database REST service and then we will download the OpenAPI file for the the Customer Database REST service that we deployed.

1\. In a browser, enter the URL for the Platform Navigator. Go to [FAQs](https://ibmintegration.github.io/jam-in-a-box/faq#TZ-ocp-console) to learn, how to access your enviroment.

2\. When prompted, use the username(admin) and password provided to you for this lab.

![Platform Navigator login page with username and password fields](./images/105.png)

4\. When you log in for the first time, you may see a **Welcome, let's get started** window.  Feel free to review the contents by click **Start the tour** or by click on the **X** to close the window.

![Welcome dialog box with 'Start the tour' button and close X option](../images/CP91.png)

5\. Navigate to the **App Connect Dashboard**.

![Platform Navigator homepage showing App Connect Dashboard tile in the integration capabilities section](../images/CP92.png)

6\. Click on the **Dashboard** icon in the left navigation.

![App Connect interface with Dashboard icon highlighted in the left navigation menu](../images/CP93.png)

7\. If you would like to create this web service yourself, follow the instructions in the **Using a REST API to manage a set of records** tutorial (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/11.0.0?topic=enterprise-toolkit-tutorials-github).  Otherwise, you can download the **CustomerDatabaseV1.bar** file for the service [here](./resources/CustomerDatabaseV1.bar).

8\. Click on **Create server**.

![App Connect Dashboard with prominent 'Create server' button in the center](../images/CP94.png)

9\. Click **Quick start toolkit integration** and click **Next**.

![Server creation wizard showing 'Quick start toolkit integration' option selected with Next button](../images/CP95.png)

10\. Drag and drop the BAR file that you just downloaded or click to upload.  Click **Next**.

![File upload interface with drag and drop area for BAR files and upload button](../images/CP96.png)

11\. Click **Next**.

![Configuration screen in the server creation wizard with Next button](../images/CP97.png)

12\. Give the Integration Server a **Name** (e.g. <span style="color: red">username</span>-customerdb) and click **Create**.

![Integration Server creation form with name field highlighted showing 'username-customerdb' format](../images/CP98.png)

13\. This will take you back to the Servers Dashboard where you will see your new server. It will likely be showing Pending while it is starting up the pod.

![Servers Dashboard showing newly created integration server with 'Pending' status](../images/CP99.png)

14\. Note: It may take a couple of minutes to start up. You can refresh the page. Once it is up and running it will show the following:

![Servers Dashboard showing integration server with 'Running' status and green checkmark](../images/CP100.png)

15\.  Click on the newly created Integration Server.

![Integration Server tile in the dashboard with server name highlighted for clicking](../images/CP101.png)

16\. Click on the **CustomerDatabaseV1** API.

![Integration Server details page showing CustomerDatabaseV1 API tile](../images/CP102.png)

17\. Confirm that the **Overview** tab is selected and click **Download OpenAPI Document**.

5\. When you log in for the first time, you may see a **Get started** window.  Feel free to review the contents and close the window.

6\. Confirm that you are in the provider organization for your username (upper right) and then click on **Develop APIs and products**.

![API Manager dashboard with provider organization name shown in upper right and 'Develop APIs and products' tile highlighted](../images/CP9.png)

7\. We are now able to begin to create APIs and Products.  Click **Add**.

![API development workspace showing prominent 'Add' button for creating new APIs and products](../images/CP10.png)

8\. Click **API (from REST, GraphQL or SOAP)**.

![Add menu dropdown showing 'API (from REST, GraphQL or SOAP)' option selected](../images/CP11.png)

9\. Click **Existing OpenAPI** under **Import** and click **Next**.

![API creation wizard showing 'Existing OpenAPI' option under Import section with Next button](../images/CP12.png)

10\.  Select the **Customer_Database-1.0.0.yaml** file that was just downloaded and click **Next**.

![File selection dialog showing Customer_Database-1.0.0.yaml file selected for upload](../images/CP13.png)

11\. Make sure that the **Activate API** <span style="color: red">is not</span> selected and click **Next**. 

![API import options showing 'Activate API' checkbox unchecked as required](../images/CP14.png)12\.  The API should be imported successfully as shown in the image below.  Click **Edit API**.

![API import success screen showing Customer Database API imported successfully with 'Edit API' button](../images/CP15.png)

## 3b. Configure the API

After importing the existing API, the first step is to configure basic security before exposing it to other developers. By creating a client key and secret security, we are able to identify the application using the API.

Next, we will define the backend endpoints where the API is actually running. IBM API Connect supports pointing to multiple backend endpoints to match your multiple build stage environments.

Finally, we will configure the proxy call to invoke the endpoint.

### i. Configure API Key Security

1\. Upon import, you will notice that an error has been detected.  Click on the **error**.

![API editor interface showing an error indicator that needs to be clicked to view details](../images/CP16.png)

2\. The error indicates that **the openapi definition must contain the 'https' scheme.**.  After reviewing the error, click on the **X** to close the window.

![Error dialog showing message about missing 'https' scheme in OpenAPI definition with X close button](../images/CP17.png)

## 3d. Publish API

In this lab, we will make the API available to developers. In order to do so, the API must be first put into a product and then published to the Sandbox catalog. A product dictates rate limits and API throttling.

When the product is published, the Invoke policy defined in the previous lab is written to the gateway.
